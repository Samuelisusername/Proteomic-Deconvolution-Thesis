# Proteomic-Deconvolution-Thesis
Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer affecting the white blood cells, called lymphocytes, which are an important part of the human immune system. To analyse this disease, many RNA-based algorithms have been proposed to estimate the cell composition of tumor environments. However, approximately one third of patients who develop a drug resistance to a subtype of lymphoma exhibit a short expected overall survival of approximately a year and a half. There remains a gap in accurate diagnosis and choosing the right strategy for an individual patient. We demonstrate the efficacy and limitations of various proteomic deconvolution methods with respective normalization strategies and provide a testing framework that generates realistic data and evaluates proteomic profile estimations to extend our current understanding of this disease.
The framework serves as a foundation for developing and benchmarking future tools that potentially generate more accurate estimations for proteomic profiles, which in turn contributes to improved fraction estimation, ultimately advancing personalized treatment strategies for lymphoma patients.
